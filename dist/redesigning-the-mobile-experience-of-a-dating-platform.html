    <div class=text-block>
      <h3 class=mt-xxl>Summary</h3>
      <p class=mt-md>
        I led the complete redesign of SL web app, a product used by millions of Brazilians every day. We dramatically
        simplified the user experience, focusing on core interactions, speed, and simplified navigation. Making it
        beautiful in the process was just the icing on the cake.
      </p>
      <h3 class=mt-xxxl>About the company</h3>
      <p class=mt-md>
        SL is the biggest Brazilian community dedicated to the kinky lifestyle with more than 8 million users. The
        company believes that society still treats sexuality as taboo, so its purpose is to provide a safe and
        judgment-free environment for people to live their fantasies. SL users subscribe to its platform to meet and
        hook up with single individuals and couples from any part of the world with total respect, security, privacy,
        and no judgments.
      </p>
      <h3 class=mt-xxxl>Context</h3>
      <p class=mt-md>
        When I joined SL in November 2014, most of the access to our website came from desktop devices, corresponding to
        an average of 88% of daily traffic. At the time, our design team was already studying the mobile-first mindset,
        but we decided to stay focused on our desktop experience due to our small team and budget constraint.
      </p>
      <p class=mt-md>
        Over time, we developed a stronger mobile vision, applying it to the new features we were launching. However, we
        had core modules in our application that were developed in the old times when the desktop was in command.
      </p>
      <p class=mt-md>
        At the beginning of 2018, we reached a rate of 80% of mobile accesses. In addition, our team had already
        received lots of feedback from our users about how bad their mobile experience was. So in the middle of 2018, I
        started a research to understand how big this problem was for our customers, our business, and the new people
        who were joining the platform.
      </p>
      <h3 class=mt-xxxl>Understanding the problem</h3>
      <p class=mt-md>
        As the initial parameter for our research, we adopted the home page and the interactions generated from it as a
        key point for understanding the experience. Firstly because it's from there that the whole experience starts,
        for new and veteran users. Secondly, because a lot of the hypotheses generated by our team involved the
        interaction with this page. As research tools we've used contextual interviews with people who have never used
        the site, browsing analysis of veteran clients with Hotjar, Analytics data, and behavioral data.
      </p>
      <p class=mt-md>
        The diversity of qualitative and quantitative data collected helped us put together a puzzle in which 6 pain
        points were identified:
      </p>
      <h3 class=mt-xxxl># Painpoint 1: Complex learning process</h3>
      <p class=mt-md>
        In my interviews with people who have never used SL, I've identified that first access to the platform is
        confusing and frustrating. All the interviewees reported the annoyance and the difficulty in dealing with
        numerous processes that ran in parallel when they board the platform (See the image below).
      </p>
    </div>

    <figure class="medium-zoom-medium mt-xxl wrapper">
      <img class=medium-zoom-image src=first-interaction.c83fc408.webp style=width:100%;height:auto alt="Image of initial screen of SL pointing all the different interactions possible when the user lands on the homepage" id>
      <figcaption class=body-small style=text-align:center>First interaction: what should I do first?</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <div class=text-block>
      <h3 class=mt-xxxl># Painpoint 2: Low value in home page content</h3>
      <p class=mt-md>
        By analyzing our users' interactions on Hotjar and events logged in Google Analytics, I noticed that new and
        veteran customers found low value on the content present on the homepage. Over 80% of the clicks were
        concentrated only on the first two content blocks.
      </p>
      <p class=mt-md>
        Beside this, people who have never used the website reported hoping to find a more personalized experience on
        this page. According to them, this page should show <i>“people compatible with them”</i> with whom it would be
        possible to get a date quickly.
      </p>
      <h3 class=mt-xl># Painpoint 3: Core features difficult to find</h3>
      <p class=mt-md>
        The biggest value we sell to our customers is finding compatible people. However, new users had a hard time
        finding the triggers to look for people of their interest.
      </p>
      <p class=mt-md>
        When I questioned the interviewees about <i>“What can you do in SL?”</i>, few of them identified the key tasks
        that could be carried out on the site. Only one person was able to find the search tool. In fact, many important
        site features were hidden deep inside the hamburger menu.
      </p>
    </div>
    <figure class="medium-zoom-medium mt-xxl">
      <video poster=menu-hamburger-poster.ef203c44.webp style=width:100%;height:auto;display:block autoplay loop muted playsinline>

      <figcaption class=body-small style=text-align:center;margin-top:8px>
        Hamburger menu hides key tasks
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <div class=text-block>
      <h3 class=mt-xxxl># Painpoint 4: Long page load time</h3>
      <p class=mt-md>
        All respondents reported discomfort with application performance. In our NPS survey, we had already identified a
        high volume of such complaints. For those interviewed, SL is generally slower and less enjoyable to browse than
        other sites they often use.
      </p>
      <h3 class=mt-xl># Painpoint 5: Low depth of navigation</h3>
      <p class=mt-md>
        By analyzing the flow of events recorded in Analytics and the usage recordings in Hotjar, we've identified that
        on mobile devices users were browsing 40% fewer pages per session than desktop devices. By observing this
        interaction, it was possible to identify the lack of triggers between modules that would allow the user to
        navigate for longer.
      </p>
      <h3 class=mt-xl># Painpoint 6: Annoying floating assistant</h3>
      <p class=mt-md>
        Right after users gets on the website there is a user assistance tool with tips to improve the evidence and
        success of the profile. Despite the effectiveness of tool conversion (75% of users interact positively with it),
        respondents reported a nuisance with it at the bottom of the page. As I mentioned earlier, the number of
        processes running at the same time may have contributed to this irritation. At first access, users felt much
        more motivated to explore the features of the site than to follow steps of something they didn't even know
        about.
      </p>
      <h3 class=mt-xl>Defining priorities</h3>
      <p class=mt-md>
        This research has brought me a number of concerns of the utmost importance to the product. Since we had a small
        development team, I had to choose which aspects of the problem we should tackle first. My decision was to start
        on two fronts:
      </p>
      <ol class="mt-md ol">
        <li class=p>
          <strong>Give evidence to the most important core features for the customer and the business.</strong> For the
          customer: find people — send a message — set up a date. For business: conversion into subscriptions,
          microtransactions, cohort retention, churn control.
        </li>
        <li class="mt-xxs p">
          <strong>The first step in simplifying the initial interaction of the client with the site,</strong> reducing
          the complexity and giving focus to the most important tasks.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class=mt-xl>Sketching and testing</h3>
      <p class=mt-md>
        Sketching brought me a lot of challenges and questions related to user interaction. My first objective was to
        prioritize and organize all the features in a way that it had a context and logic order to users. As can be seen
        in pain point 3, all the features were hidden inside the hamburger menu without hierarchy and meaning to the
        user.
      </p>
      <p class=mt-md>
        I made a new round of data analysis in order to validate some hypothesis about on what frequency users
        interacted with some features in order to rearrange the experience without losing the connection between many
        processes that were running along the journey. Any change in the interface could impact extremely important
        business KPI's.
      </p>
      <h3 class=mt-xl>Usability tests</h3>
      <p class=mt-md>
        After refining the sketches, I could prepare a prototype to test with users. We spent a week interviewing and
        running usability tests with single individuals and couples carefully selected according to our different
        personas. Tasks were selected based on their importance to customer success, their impact on key business
        metrics, and the level of strangeness some changes in interface and information architecture could cause to the
        users.
      </p>
      <h3 class=mt-xl>Tasks</h3>
      <ol class="mt-md ol">
        <li class=p>
          Access a photo on your profile
        </li>
        <li class="mt-xxs p">
          Find someone on the website that matches your criteria
        </li>
        <li class="mt-xxs p">
          Access the Groups page
        </li>
        <li class="mt-xxs p">
          Change your location to Campinas
        </li>
        <li class="mt-xxs p">
          Accept your friendship requests
        </li>
        <li class="mt-xxs p">
          Buy a subscription plan
        </li>
        <li class="mt-xxs p">
          Buy a Token package
        </li>
        <li class="mt-xxs p">
          Post a photo to your profile
        </li>
        <li class="mt-xxs p">
          Find the expiration date of your subscription
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class=mt-xl>Results of the usability tests</h3>
      <p class=mt-md>
        The results proved that most of the users were able to complete the tasks with ease. In fact, reactions
        (including both verbal and non-verbal cues) to the prototype showed that they were confident in navigating the
        pages. Several of them also expressed their satisfaction at the simplicity of the interface and the facility of
        finding the usual features that they accessed frequently.
      </p>
      <p class=mt-md>
        While our main concerns were in tasks such as <i>“Access your profile”</i>, <i>“Find a person”</i> or <i>“Buy a
          subscription”</i>, there were minor hesitations only in distinguishing system notifications from friend
        requests notifications, although they were still able to differentiate it. In conclusion, we've validated all
        the key aspects we wanted and there was no need to perform a new round of tests.
      </p>
      <h3 class=mt-xl>A new simplified experience</h3>
      <p class=mt-md>
        As we discussed earlier, in the final interface I could semantically group elements of the interface according
        to its usage and logical order. The main challenge was to understand which features should be placed on the
        first level, in a way that the user could have fast access to it anytime in their navigation.
      </p>
      <p class=mt-md>
        The Hamburger Menu has been discontinued and all the important modules now can be accessed with one single touch
        in the Home Page. All the elements present in the old menu were rearranged according to its meaning and
        importance to the user. In the bottom navigation bar, I selected the most important and recurrent features used
        by all of our personas. In the usability tests, this type of navigation has proved very efficient and
        comfortable, encouraging the users to interact more.
      </p>
      <p class=mt-md>
        The UI had subtle changes in order to improve legibility and reduce complexity. The typeface acquired a darker
        black and a lighter weight and the background was brightened to provide greater visual comfort. Besides that,
        the buttons lost their shapes but gained contrast as their typeface became colored.

      <h3 class=mt-xl>A brand new and convenient profile page</h3>
      <p class=mt-md>
        One of the biggest changes in the navigation was the new profile page. In this section, I organized all the
        features related to the user profile, account settings, and privacy options. In the old interface, all these
        elements were lost inside the hamburger menu and other areas of difficult access. I took great care on
        preserving some essential features:
      </p>
      <ol class="mt-md ol">
        <li class=p>
          <strong>
            For the business: The call to action for subscription and token purchase;
          </strong>
        </li>
        <li class="mt-xxs p">
          <strong>
            For the user: Access to public profile and profile edition.
          </strong>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3 class=mt-xl>Defining business KPI's</h3>
      <p class=mt-md>
        In order to define the success of our project, I defined some KPI's that must be followed after releasing. Each
        metric should be analyzed carefully to understand its impact on the business and the user experience. These were
        the chosen indicators:
      </p>
      <h4 class=mt-xl>Access metrics</h4>
      <ul class="mt-md ul">
        <li class=p>
          Sessions per user (per day, month)
        </li>
        <li class="mt-xxs p">
          Average session duration
        </li>
        <li class="mt-xxs p">
          Pages per session
        </li>
        <li class="mt-xxs p">
          Pages per session
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class=mt-xl>Activity metrics</h4>
      <ul class="mt-md ol">
        <li class="mt-xxs p">
          Retention cohort
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class=mt-xl>Conversion metrics</h4>
      <ul class="mt-md ul">
        <li class="mt-xxs p">
          Conversion rate
        </li>
        <li class="mt-xxs p">
          Time to the first sent message
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class=mt-xl>Custom metrics</h4>
      <ul class="mt-md ul">
        <li class="mt-xxs p">
          Engagement Score (Based on the activity level on the platform)
        </li>
        <li class="mt-xxs p">
          Success Score (message response rate)
        </li>
        <li class="mt-xxs p">
          Onboarding Key Metrics (Completed steps)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class=mt-xl>Next steps</h3>
      <p class=mt-md>
        By the time I left this project, it was under a test with a restricted group of beta testers so that the
        analysis of the KPIs could be made and feedback collected to make the necessary adjustments. Once the team
        validated all the key points of the project, a beta version would be released little by little to new users so
        that in a few months it could be offered to the entire customer base.
