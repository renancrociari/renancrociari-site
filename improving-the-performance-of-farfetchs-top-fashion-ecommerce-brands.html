        <h3 class="mt-xxl">Summary and outcomes</h3>
        <p class="mt-md">
          I joined Farfetch as the <strong>first Product Designer to lead a new initiative</strong> aimed at improving the performance of B2C clients operating on the Farfetch e-commerce platform. This included working with brands such as Off-White, Emilio Pucci, Roberto Cavalli, Ami, Stadium Goods, and Browns Fashion. I led efforts to establish fundamental design practices and processes focused on <strong>optimizing e-commerce performance indicators and enhancing the overall user experience</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-md">
          We collaborated with over 12 different fashion brands to improve the results of their online retail stores. In one of our first projects, we worked with Pucci, achieving an <strong>87.5% increase in conversion rate</strong>, a <strong>57% reduction in bounce rate</strong>, and an <strong>8.69% revenue growth from 2019 to 2020</strong>.

        <h3 class="mt-xxxxl">My role and responsibilities</h3>
        <p class="mt-md">
          At Farfetch, I led efforts to establish key design practices and processes focused on optimizing e-commerce performance indicators and enhancing the user experience for boutiques on the Farfetch platform. I worked closely with 3 Product Managers, a Data Analyst, and a UX Researcher, providing deep insights into customer behavior, friction points, their impact on the business, and proposing solutions to improve key performance metrics.

        <h3 class="mt-xxxxl">Methods and tools</h3>
        <p class="mt-md">
          For each project at Farfetch, a variety of methods and tools were used to generate insights, which were then cross-referenced to identify opportunities for improvement. The Optimization team worked closely with the business, engineering, marketing, and commercial teams to plan and prioritize solutions that would enhance the performance of our partners. Below are the main tools we used in our analysis:
        </p>
        <ul class="ul">
          <li class="p mt-md">
            <strong>UserTesting.com:</strong> a platform for gathering quick customer feedback through remote user testing. We used this tool to recruit fashion shoppers, identify pain points in their purchasing journeys, and test new features.
          </li>
          <li class="p mt-md">
            <strong>Hotjar:</strong> a product experience insights platform that provides behavioral analytics and feedback data to better understand customer behavior. We primarily used heatmaps to identify areas of focus and recordings to analyze navigation patterns.
          </li>
          <li class="p mt-md">
            <strong>Google Analytics:</strong> our main analytics tool for measuring website performance. Google Analytics helped us track key performance indicators and events, giving us insights into how users interacted with the websites.
          </li>
          <li class="p mt-md">
            <strong>A/B Testing:</strong> a methodology for comparing two versions of a webpage to determine which performs better. Farfetch has an extensive knowledge base of A/B tests conducted across its eCommerce brands, providing a valuable source of insights.
          </li>
          <li class="p mt-md">
            <strong>Knowledge Database:</strong> Farfetch maintains a robust knowledge database containing consolidated learnings from all teams across the company. We leveraged this resource to optimize our projects and also contributed significantly by adding our insights from working with various brands.
          </li>
          <li class="p mt-md">
            <strong>Predictive Eye Tracking:</strong> this tool provided insights into users' visual attention, identifying which elements on a web page attracted the most attention. It helped evaluate if the website had a clear visual hierarchy and ensured that users' attention flowed through essential page elements. AI-generated heatmaps also revealed any distractions from call-to-action buttons (CTAs).

        <h3 class="mt-xxxl">Case study Emilio Pucci</h3>
        <p class="mt-md">
          Emilio Pucci is one of the most influential brands in fashion history. Known for its lightweight fabrics and iconic prints, the brand became synonymous with carefree elegance, attracting high-profile clients such as Jacqueline Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe. In 2000, Pucci was acquired by LVMH (Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton), a luxury conglomerate that manages some of the world's most prestigious brands, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fendi, and Off-White.

          We worked with Pucci for nearly a year, focusing on improving the key performance indicators of their e-commerce website. Our team conducted a comprehensive, 360-degree analysis of the store, mapping user pain points, usage patterns, and performance metrics to propose targeted business solutions.

          Below are the key insights collected during our analysis of the Pucci website:

        <h3 class="mt-xxl">Product Listing Page (PLP)</h3>
        <p class="mt-md">
          Product Listing Pages (PLPs) display products based on selected categories or applied search filters. A well-designed PLP strikes a balance between showcasing products and providing a user-friendly interface that allows customers to easily narrow down their search. On Pucci's website, several issues with the filters were identified:
        </p>
        <ul class="ul">
          <li class="p mt-md">
            <strong>Filters are hard to find:</strong> Most users had trouble locating the filters, as they were hidden under a small dropdown labeled “Filter.” This made it difficult for them to refine their search.
          </li>
          <li class="p mt-md">
            <strong>Filter options don't update as users click:</strong> During user testing, we found that users struggled to narrow down product results because the filter options weren't dynamically updated as they made selections. For example, when a user filtered by an attribute like color, the other filter options (such as size or material) didn't adjust to show only the available choices based on that color selection. Dynamic Filters would solve this issue by ensuring that once a user selects a filter, the remaining options automatically update to reflect only the available choices. This approach helps users see relevant filtering options as they navigate, making it easier to refine their search and find what they're looking for.
          </li>
          <li class="p mt-md">
            <strong>Filters missing key product attributes:</strong> Users noted the absence of important product attributes in the filters that are essential for decision-making. During testing, they mentioned attributes like clothing style, sleeve type, and length as essential information to support their purchase decisions.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-xxxl">Product Detail Page (PDP)</h3>
        <p class="mt-md">
          A Product Detail Page (PDP) must provide all the essential information for customers to make an informed purchasing decision. It should give users everything they need to know about a product, eliminating the need to visit a physical store. This includes details like the product's appearance, materials, fit, delivery costs, and return policies. A well-designed PDP builds confidence, increasing conversion rates and reducing returns. Below are the main findings from the analysis of Pucci's e-commerce site:
        </p>
        <ul class="ul">
          <li class="p mt-md">
            <strong>Size Guide is Difficult to find:</strong> user testing revealed that customers struggled to locate the size guide. This resource is crucial in fashion eCommerce as it helps users determine the right size and fit. A clear and comprehensive size guide should explain how to measure correctly and select the right size, boosting purchase confidence and reducing returns.
          </li>
          <li class="p mt-md">
            <strong>Sizing system is not specified:</strong> many users reported that the sizing unit was unclear, leading to hesitation in completing the purchase. Sizing systems differ between countries and product types (e.g., Italian vs. American sizes). Clearly stating the sizing system helps users choose the correct size with confidence.
          </li>
          <li class="p mt-md">
            <strong>Insufficient information about how the piece fits the body:</strong> users noted a lack of details regarding how the product would fit their body. Beyond the sizing system, additional information such as whether the fit is tight or loose, body measurements, and fabric details help customers understand how the item will look and feel on different body types.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <div class="text-block">
        <h3 class="mt-xxxl">Checkout</h3>
        <p class="mt-md">
          The Checkout process in e-commerce is a critical point where customers move from browsing to purchasing. The best checkout designs are simple, straightforward, and provide all the necessary information to help shoppers complete their purchase quickly, easily, and securely. The process should be free from distractions, disruptions, or any friction points.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-md"> 
          Through an analysis of Google Analytics metrics, Hotjar recordings, usability testing, and predictive eye-tracking, several issues were identified in Pucci's checkout:
        </p>
        <ul class="ul">
          <li class="p mt-md">
            <strong>Users had difficulty progressing through checkout steps:</strong> many users struggled to complete their purchases because the checkout interface lacked clear guidance. The system didn't properly indicate the steps required to move forward, nor did it provide helpful feedback when users made mistakes. As a result, users often had to jump back and forth between steps, and some only realized they had missed filling in crucial information when they clicked “Purchase.” This caused frustration and delayed the checkout process for all of the interviewees.
          </li>
          <li class="p mt-md">
            <strong>Missing shipping and returns information:</strong> users noted the absence of key information about estimated delivery dates and return policies, which caused hesitation during the purchasing process. Many users expressed the need to confirm these details before deciding to complete their purchase. Additionally, some users reported the lack of a phone number to contact in case they encountered any issues or had questions during checkout.
