        <h3 class="mt-xl">Summary</h3>
        <p class="mt-md">
          I led the complete redesign of SL web app, a product used by millions of Brazilians every day. We dramatically simplified the user experience, focusing on core interactions, speed, and simplified navigation. Making it beautiful in the process was just the icing on the cake.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mt-xxxl">About the company</h3>
        <p class="mt-md">
          SL is the biggest Brazilian community dedicated to the kinky lifestyle with more than 8 million users. The company believes that society still treats sexuality as taboo, so its purpose is to provide a safe and judgment-free environment for people to live their fantasies. SL users subscribe to its platform to meet and hook up with single individuals and couples from any part of the world with total respect, security, privacy, and no judgments. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="mt-xxxl">Context</h3>
        <p class="mt-md">
          When I joined SL in November 2014, most of the access to our website came from desktop devices, corresponding to an average of 88% of daily traffic. At the time, our design team was already studying the mobile-first mindset, but we decided to stay focused on our desktop experience due to our small team and budget constraint.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-md">
          Over time, we developed a stronger mobile vision, applying it to the new features we were launching. However, we had core modules in our application that were developed in the old times when the desktop was in command.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-md">
          At the beginning of 2018, we reached a rate of 80% of mobile accesses. In addition, our team had already received lots of feedback from our users about how bad their mobile experience was. So in the middle of 2018, I started a research to understand how big this problem was for our customers, our business, and the new people who were joining the platform.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mt-xxxl">Understanding the problem</h3>
        <p class="mt-md">
          As the initial parameter for our research, we adopted the home page and the interactions generated from it as a key point for understanding the experience. Firstly because it's from there that the whole experience starts, for new and veteran users. Secondly, because a lot of the hypotheses generated by our team involved the interaction with this page. As research tools we've used contextual interviews with people who have never used the site, browsing analysis of veteran clients with Hotjar, Analytics data, and behavioral data.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-md">
          The diversity of qualitative and quantitative data collected helped us put together a puzzle in which 6 pain points were identified:
        </p>
        <h3 class="mt-xxxl"># Painpoint 1: Complex learning process</h3>
        <p class="mt-md">
          In my interviews with people who have never used SL, I've identified that first access to the platform is confusing and frustrating. All the interviewees reported the annoyance and the difficulty in dealing with numerous processes that ran in parallel when they board the platform (See the image below).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="text-block">
        <h3 class="mt-xl"># Painpoint 2: Low value in home page content</h3>
        <p class="mt-md">
          By analyzing our users’ interactions on Hotjar and events logged in Google Analytics, I noticed that new and veteran customers found low value on the content present on the homepage. Over 80% of the clicks were concentrated only on the first two content blocks.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-md">
          Beside this, people who have never used the website reported hoping to find a more personalized experience on this page. According to them, this page should show <i>“people compatible with them”</i> with whom it would be possible to get a date quickly.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mt-xl"># Painpoint 3: Core features difficult to find</h3>
        <p class="mt-md">
          The biggest value we sell to our customers is finding compatible people. However, new users had a hard time finding the triggers to look for people of their interest.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-md">
          When I questioned the interviewees about <i>“What can you do in SL?”</i>, few of them identified the key tasks that could be carried out on the site. Only one person was able to find the search tool. In fact, many important site features were hidden deep inside the hamburger menu.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mt-xl"># Painpoint 4: Long page load time</h3>
        <p class="mt-md">
          All respondents reported discomfort with application performance. In our NPS survey, we had already identified a high volume of such complaints. For those interviewed, SL is generally slower and less enjoyable to browse than other sites they often use.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mt-xl"># Painpoint 5: Low depth of navigation</h3>
        <p class="mt-md">
          By analyzing the flow of events recorded in Analytics and the usage recordings in Hotjar, we've identified that on mobile devices users were browsing 40% fewer pages per session than desktop devices. By observing this interaction, it was possible to identify the lack of triggers between modules that would allow the user to navigate for longer.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mt-xl"># Painpoint 6: Annoying floating assistant</h3>
        <p class="mt-md">
          Right after users gets on the website there is a user assistance tool with tips to improve the evidence and success of the profile. Despite the effectiveness of tool conversion (75% of users interact positively with it), respondents reported a nuisance with it at the bottom of the page. As I mentioned earlier, the number of processes running at the same time may have contributed to this irritation. At first access, users felt much more motivated to explore the features of the site than to follow steps of something they didn't even know about.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mt-xl">Defining priorities</h3>
        <p class="mt-md">
          This research has brought me a number of concerns of the utmost importance to the product. Since we had a small development team, I had to choose which aspects of the problem we should tackle first. My decision was to start on two fronts:
        </p>
        <ol class="ol" type="1">
          <li class="p">The pain points identified in the interview</li>
          <li class="p">The pain points identified in the interview</li>
