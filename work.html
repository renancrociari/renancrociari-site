        <div class="heya-im-renan1">
          I led the complete redesign of SL web app, a product used by millions
          of Brazilians every day. We dramatically simplified the user
          experience, focusing on core interactions, speed, and simplified
          navigation. Making it beautiful in the process was just the icing on
          the cake.
        </div>
        <b class="why-did-i2">About the company</b>
        <div class="heya-im-renan2">
          SL is the biggest Brazilian community dedicated to the kinky lifestyle
          with more than 8 million users. The company believes that society
          still treats sexuality as taboo, so its purpose is to provide a safe
          and judgment-free environment for people to live their fantasies. SL
          users subscribe to its platform to meet and hook up with single
          individuals and couples from any part of the world with total respect,
          security, privacy, and no judgments.
        </div>
        <b class="why-did-i3">The context</b>
        <div class="heya-im-renan-container">
          <p class="when-i-joined">
            When I joined SL in November 2014, most of the access to our website
            came from desktop devices, corresponding to an average of 88% of
            daily traffic. At the time, our design team was already studying the
            mobile-first mindset, but we decided to stay focused on our desktop
            experience due to our small team and budget constraint.
          </p>
          <p class="over-time-we">
            Over time, we developed a stronger mobile vision, applying it to the
            new features we were launching. However, we had core modules in our
            application that were developed in the old times when the desktop
            was in command.
          </p>
          <p class="at-the-beginning">
            At the beginning of 2018, we reached a rate of 80% of mobile
            accesses. In addition, our team had already received lots of
            feedback from our users about how bad their mobile experience was.
            So in the middle of 2018, I started a research to understand how big
            this problem was for our customers, our business, and the new people
            who were joining the platform.
          </p>
        </div>
        <b class="why-did-i4">Understanding the problem</b>
        <div class="heya-im-renan-container1">
          <p class="as-the-initial">
            As the initial parameter for our research, we adopted the home page
            and the interactions generated from it as a key point for
            understanding the experience. Firstly because it’s from there that
            the whole experience starts, for new and veteran users. Secondly,
            because a lot of the hypotheses generated by our team involved the
            interaction with this page. As research tools we’ve used contextual
            interviews with people who have never used the site, browsing
            analysis of veteran clients with Hotjar, Analytics data, and
            behavioral data.
          </p>
          <p class="the-diversity-of">
            The diversity of qualitative and quantitative data collected helped
            us put together a puzzle in which 6 pain points were identified:
          </p>
        </div>
        <b class="why-did-i5"># Pain point 1: Complex learning process</b>
        <div class="heya-im-renan3">
          In my interviews with people who have never used SL, I’ve identified
          that first access to the platform is confusing and frustrating. All
          the interviewees reported the annoyance and the difficulty in dealing
          with numerous processes that ran in parallel when they board the
          platform (See the image below).
        </div>
        <b class="why-did-i6"># Pain point 2: Low value in home page content</b>
        <div class="heya-im-renan-container2">
          <p class="by-analyzing-our">
            By analyzing our users’ interactions on Hotjar and events logged in
            Google Analytics, I noticed that new and veteran customers found low
            value on the content present on the homepage. Over 80% of the clicks
            were concentrated only on the first two content blocks.
          </p>
          <p class="beside-this-people">
            Beside this, people who have never used the website reported hoping
            to find a more personalized experience on this page. According to
            them, this page should show “people compatible with them” with whom
            it would be possible to get a date quickly.

        <b class="why-did-i9"># Pain point 5: Low depth of navigation</b>
        <div class="heya-im-renan-container3">
          <p class="the-biggest-value">
            The biggest value we sell to our customers is finding compatible
            people. However, new users had a hard time finding the triggers to
            look for people of their interest.
          </p>
          <p class="when-i-questioned">
            When I questioned the interviewees about “What can you do in SL?”,
            few of them identified the key tasks that could be carried out on
            the site. Only one person was able to find the search tool. In fact,
            many important site features were hidden deep inside the hamburger
            menu.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="heya-im-renan4">
          All respondents reported discomfort with application performance. In
          our NPS survey, we had already identified a high volume of such
          complaints. For those interviewed, SL is generally slower and less
          enjoyable to browse than other sites they often use.

        <b class="why-did-i12">Sketching and testing</b>
        <div class="heya-im-renan6">
          Right after users gets on the website there is a user assistance tool
          with tips to improve the evidence and success of the profile. Despite
          the effectiveness of tool conversion (75% of users interact positively
          with it), respondents reported a nuisance with it at the bottom of the
          page. As I mentioned earlier, the number of processes running at the
          same time may have contributed to this irritation. At first access,
          users felt much more motivated to explore the features of the site
          than to follow steps of something they didn’t even know about.
        </div>
        <div class="heya-im-renan-container4">
          <p class="this-research-has">
            This research has brought me a number of concerns of the utmost
            importance to the product. Since we had a small development team, I
            had to choose which aspects of the problem we should tackle first.
            My decision was to start on two fronts:
          </p>
          <ol class="give-evidence-to-the-most-impo">
            <li class="give-evidence-to">
              Give evidence to the most important core features for the customer
              and the business. For the customer: find people — send a message —
              set up a date. For business: conversion into subscriptions,
              microtransactions, cohort retention, churn control.
            </li>
            <li>
              The first step in simplifying the initial interaction of the
              client with the site, reducing the complexity and giving focus to
              the most important tasks.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="heya-im-renan-container5">
          <p class="sketching-brought-me">
            Sketching brought me a lot of challenges and questions related to
            user interaction. My first objective was to prioritize and organize
            all the features in a way that it had a context and logic order to
            users. As can be seen in pain point 3, all the features were hidden
            inside the hamburger menu without hierarchy and meaning to the user.
          </p>
          <p class="i-made-a">
            I made a new round of data analysis in order to validate some
            hypothesis about on what frequency users interacted with some
            features in order to rearrange the experience without losing the
            connection between many processes that were running along the
            journey. Any change in the interface could impact extremely
            important business KPI’s.
          </p>

        <b class="why-did-i13">Usability tests</b>
        <div class="heya-im-renan7">
          After refining the sketches, I could prepare a prototype to test with
          users. We spent a week interviewing and running usability tests with
          single individuals and couples carefully selected according to our
          different personas. Tasks were selected based on their importance to
          customer success, their impact on key business metrics, and the level
          of strangeness some changes in interface and information architecture
          could cause to the users.

        <b class="why-did-i15">Results of the Usability Test:</b>
        <div class="heya-im-renan-container7">
          <p class="the-results-proved">
            The results proved that most of the users were able to complete the
            tasks with ease. In fact, reactions (including both verbal and
            non-verbal cues) to the prototype showed that they were confident in
            navigating the pages. Several of them also expressed their
            satisfaction at the simplicity of the interface and the facility of
            finding the usual features that they accessed frequently.
          </p>
          <p class="while-our-main">
            While our main concerns were in tasks such as “Access your profile”,
            “Find a person” or “Buy a subscription”, there were minor
            hesitations only in distinguishing system notifications from friend
            requests notifications, although they were still able to
            differentiate it. In conclusion, we've validated all the key aspects
            we wanted and there was no need to perform a new round of tests.
          </p>
        </div>
        <b class="why-did-i16">A new simplified experience</b>
        <div class="heya-im-renan-container8">
          <p class="as-we-discussed">
            As we discussed earlier, in the final interface I could semantically
            group elements of the interface according to its usage and logical
            order. The main challenge was to understand which features should be
            placed on the first level, in a way that the user could have fast
            access to it anytime in their navigation.
          </p>
          <p class="the-hamburger-menu">
            The Hamburger Menu has been discontinued and all the important
            modules now can be accessed with one single touch in the Home Page.
            All the elements present in the old menu were rearranged according
            to its meaning and importance to the user. In the bottom navigation
            bar, I selected the most important and recurrent features used by
            all of our personas. In the usability tests, this type of navigation
            has proved very efficient and comfortable, encouraging the users to
            interact more.
          </p>
          <p class="the-ui-had">
            The UI had subtle changes in order to improve legibility and reduce
            complexity. The typeface acquired a darker black and a lighter
            weight and the background was brightened to provide greater visual
            comfort. Besides that, the buttons lost their shapes but gained
            contrast as their typeface became colored.

          <p class="one-of-the">
            One of the biggest changes in the navigation was the new profile
            page. In this section, I organized all the features related to the
            user profile, account settings, and privacy options. In the old
            interface, all these elements were lost inside the hamburger menu
            and other areas of difficult access. I took great care on preserving
            some essential features:
